Snake Water Gun Game in Python

Introduction

The Snake Water Gun game is a popular hand game similar to Rock Paper Scissors. This game is often played between two players, where each player chooses one of the three options:

Snake beats Water (Snake drinks water)

Water beats Gun (Gun sinks in water)

Gun beats Snake (Gun shoots snake)


In this project, we create a Python-based Snake Water Gun game where the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices, and the user provides input. The winner is decided based on the rules above.

Project Features

✅ Randomized Computer Choice – The program uses Python’s random module to generate the computer’s choice.
✅ User Input Handling – The user is prompted to enter their choice.
✅ Game Logic Implementation – The program checks who wins the round based on predefined rules.
✅ Score Tracking – The game keeps track of rounds and final scores.
✅ Loop for Multiple Rounds – The user can play multiple rounds before exiting.


Conclusion

The Snake Water Gun game is a fun Python project that helps beginners practice conditional statements, loops, user input handling, and randomness. This game can be further enhanced with additional features like a GUI and multiplayer mode.
